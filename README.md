How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
**You can ensure that your code is functional and secure by running the appropriate tests.  After writing small sections of code it is important to run tests on it.  There are
many automated tests that help with this.  In this class I used Junit testing.  It is important to ensure that the whole tested program is covered by the Junit test.  After each section is properly tested and working, integration testing is next.  This consists of combining the different sections of code and testing whether they work properly together.**

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
**Gathering user needs through user stories and interviews will help me understand what the user wants in their program.  After gathering all the information from the user, I 
will plan my code by using notes and diagrams.  When I start developing the program I will constantly refer back to these notes and diagrams on what the user wants.  I will also center my testing around what is expected of the program based on the user needs.**

How do I approach designing software?
**I approach designing software by using the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process.  The first step is planning what I will be doing. Next, defining, designing, building, testing, and deployment.  However, I will test my program throughout its entire lifecycle.**
